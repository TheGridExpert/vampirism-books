  <h2>Ashes of Past Dawns</h2>
  <p><em>by Marcus Grid</em></p>
  <section class="page">
    <p>I was born in a small village at the very edge of our lands, a place the name of which has long been erased not only from maps, but also from human memory itself. Once, it thrived at the crossroads of trade routes, caravans passed through bearing salt, cloth, and iron. Merchants would often linger in the taverns and inns, yet despite what one might expect, gold never took root in our soil. People lived modestly: some worked the loom, others tilled and sowed the fields. <br><br>My family didn't stand out much from the general mass of people. Though my father, as you might guess from my surname &quot;Grid&quot;, came from the west. In his golden years he roamed from settlement to settlement with goods slung over his back. That nomadic life ended the night he stopped in one northern village. By candlelight in a church, he saw a maiden of unseen beauty. That was my mother. For her, he stayed, settled, married, and began saving for a house. My mother was a gifted seamstress: her embroidered shirts and garments were even bought in large cities where my father traveled to sell his wares. As if she had a premonition, she began sewing shirts for children well before they were born. First came my older brother, then me, and lastly our younger sister.<br><br>But, as is so often the case, the wind of change blew in a different direction. For some time, there had been whispers in the village about a gang of bandits roaming the nearby lands, robbing and murdering the innocent. Sadly, rumor turned into reality: our home was ransacked and burned to the ground. It was a miracle that we survived at all: no one was inside that ill-fated day. All that remained of what was once a warm, lively hearth was a patch of charred earth. There was no choice but to sell it, and the money earned barely covered a flimsy shack and a handful of sheep. Since then, Father had sworn off trading for good – there was neither money nor strength left for it. He turned to herding, while Mother spun thread and sewed clothes from it, just like she used to. As the years passed, my younger brother and two sisters were born. Though I missed our old dear home, there was nothing to be done.<br><br>I was around twelve when my older brother left for the city to find work while I was helping my father watch over the flock. Shepherd life held little excitement, mostly just leading the sheep out to pasture and bringing them back again. I began to think I had settled into this new life, but then in just one summer day, like a thunder in the clear sky, everything turned to ash. Father stayed at home to clean the sheepfold, while I, having led the flock to a meadow, as usual, laid down on the grass still wet from the rain. The day was drawing towards evening, a breeze stirred the air. I was just about to get up and head back with the herd when I decided to feel that nice chill a little longer. And so, I fell asleep.<br><br>I awoke at dawn – a sheep was licking my cheek with its rough tongue. Realizing I had slept through the entire night, I leapt to my feet. To my surprise, all the sheep were in place. They were huddled tightly together, shifting nervously, as if something had been disturbing them all that time. I counted them – every sheep was in place. That wasn't the only thing that struck me as strange. Not a wolf, not a fox, not a single predator had dared to approach them, even though the forest wasn’t far away. A heavy silence hung over the field, and a strange unease stirred in my chest. It was as if all the animals were afraid of something, but I couldn’t put my finger on it.<br><br>Anxiously glancing around, I drove the sheep back home. I wasn’t even thinking about what I would say to my father, how I’d explain nearly losing the flock after falling asleep in the middle of a field. I just wanted to get home. As I approached the house, bathed in the golden light of the rising sun, everything seemed lifeless. Something was wrong. Not a sound – only the same dead silence as out in the steppe. Not a dense one, but there was a thin mist clinging low to the ground, making everything feel even more unsettling. <br><br>Putting the sheep in the pen, I walked up to the door. It was swaying on a single hinge, as if someone had broken it down. I froze: right in front of me lay my father. His chest was shredded in several places. In the corner, fallen off the bed, was my mother. In the next room – my brothers and sisters. All dead. For a long time, I couldn’t process what I was seeing. I did not want to accept that it was real. My mind tried to insist it was just a dream, just another nightmare like the ones that I had been having more and more often lately. But the cold, the stench of blood, and the crushing silence proved otherwise.<br><br>Having come to my senses, I jumped outside and rushed over to our neighbors. I ran from door to door only to be met with the same gruesome sight: broken doors, mutilated bodies, death. The entire village had been slaughtered. Alone in a village of the dead, I ran, not caring where my feet carried me – just somewhere, anywhere, where there were still living souls. By the time the sun was at its zenith, I reached a town. Words cannot describe the relief I felt when I saw a living guard at the gates. He called out to me, and through tears and with a trembling voice, I told him everything. To my surprise, without further question, the town raised not guards, but a group of vampire hunters. They immediately set out, taking me with them.<br><br>It must be said that, even to this day, the steppe remained largely beyond the control of both vampires and hunters. These were open, empty lands, places with nowhere to hide or take cover. For vampires, there was no shelter from the sun, and fewer animals than in the forests. For hunters, the wind-blasted terrain made fortifications difficult, and with their primary enemy rarely venturing there, patrolling the steppes served little purpose. The nearby lands were mostly used by farmers, shepherds, and traders like my father, since trade routes passed not so far away. That was also why hunters occasionally stopped by – but usually just for a night, on their way to larger settlements where, despite the region's peculiarities, their input was still needed.<br><br>After arriving, the leader of hunters silently walked through the village, examining empty houses and lifeless bodies. Then he said, &quot;It has happened again. Another village – the same story&quot;. I looked at him. The hunter, noticing the horror in my eyes, tried to calm me, though his words only deepened my dread. Those incidents, as he said, had been happening more and more frequently lately.<br><br>The hunters believed vampires were the ones behind all of that. This wasn’t in the style of bandits or pillagers, and certainly not wild animals. And yet, even for vampires, this was strange. Usually, they left some survivors in order to turn them and subjugate to their will. The rest were used for blood. Eventually, the conquered village would raise vampire banners and become a stronghold for their kind. But here, it was as if an angel of death had passed through the streets. With no gain, with no purpose, with nothing but the desire to end every last life. The hunters tried to find some pattern in the destruction of villages, but nothing ever came of it.<br><br>Something had changed. Not just my life, but myself, something in the depths of my soul. Maybe I had been lucky to escape the blade of that &quot;angel of death&quot;, but inside I had still died. From that night onward it was if I had become a different person. I stopped laughing, I stopped crying. Pleasant memories of the past followed me like shadows. Nearly every night I dreamed of my family – scenes from days long gone. Sometimes, I’d just freeze in place, mentally dragged back to that damned night, forced to live it again and again.<br><br>After those events, I was taken in by a pastor from a church in the city I had fled to, shaking with terror. I wasn’t the only child to find a home there: the pastor cared for all orphans, whether they had lost their parents to vampire raids or had simply been abandoned to fate. He became like a father to us. At that time, parish schools had only just begun to appear here, offering basic education even to the children of the poor. We were no exception, especially since we lived there. It was the place where I learned to read and write and was taught the foundations of morality and faith. Though I never became a priest, the knowledge I gained proved invaluable.<br><br>The pastor taught us a bit of everything, but his main focus was theology and religious rites. I remember he had his own small library – just a few shelves, but even now that would be considered a luxury. Back then, it was a true treasure, both materially and spiritually. He allowed us to borrow books and read them, but only under his supervision, so we wouldn’t accidentally tear the fragile pages. What fascinated me the most were the alchemy books. Centuries ago, when this science first emerged, the church condemned it fiercely, equating it with witchcraft. But over time, things changed. Vampire hunters became the last defense for the faith and shrines. And so, willingly or not, the church found itself under their protection – and with that, alchemy shed its label as a sin. Though many priests still looked down on alchemists with scorn, our pastor was adding new books on the subject to his collection after noticing our interest.<br><br>We were mostly fed porridge, chowders, sometimes cooked with the blood left over from slaughtered livestock. It was no feast, but to us, it felt like a piece of culinary art. Years later, as an adult, I tried recreating that taste to remember the old days. But I never managed to: maybe the ingredients were different, or perhaps me.<br><br>That's how my young years passed — under the roof of the temple, among books and the toll of bells. I originally wanted to devote my life fully to church work, to go into the priesthood. But after so many years within those walls, I no longer wanted to stay there for the rest of my life, my soul yearned for something else.<br><br>Meanwhile, the situation in the world was getting worse and worse. Vampire attacks on human settlements became commonplace, and our town was no exception. Praise be to heaven, and to the hunters and city guards who managed to repel their attacks for many years. But with each passing year, the raids grew more savage, and it became harder for our defenders to keep the enemy beyond the walls. When I was nearly seventeen, an even worse disaster struck the city. In the dead of night, the vampires broke through the defenses and burst inside. They prowled the streets, attacking anyone they saw, while the surviving hunters did everything they could to fight them off.<br><br>Our temple stood at the very edge of the city, not far from the gates. The orphanage attached to the church was housed in a separate building nearby. I was sleeping peacefully when I heard the bells of the belfry ringing the alarm. Outside, I could hear clamor and the clang of weapons. They were soon joined by a loud stomping and squeals of people echoing from the church entrance. Its doors swung open with a clatter, and a crowd stormed in. The children sleeping in the neighboring beds shrank against the walls, too terrified to even breathe.<br><br>I crept cautiously to a small window, trying to understand what was happening. On the church steps stood several strange figures. Just before they reached the gates, the ones inside managed to slam them shut. One figure, leading the rest, kicked the doors clean off their hinges without hesitation. As the creature crossed the threshold of the sacred place, its skin began to smolder and smoke. It stopped, recoiling, as flaming scraps of flesh sloughed from its body. The leader gave a signal, and the horde of its subordinates surged inside. The vampires pounced on everyone who had sought shelter there. Though they burned more slowly than their master, they still moaned in agony as flames licked their bodies, but it didn’t stop them from killing. The more blood they spilled, the more fiercely they burned, and when the last living soul was gone, their screams faded too. I stood frozen with terror, unsure whether to flee or pray. That first figure began to move slowly in our direction. <br><br>Not even a minute passed before someone knocked, no, smashed our door down with a deafening crack. A woman entered the room, her eyes glowing with a searing crimson fire. &quot;What luck…&quot; she purred, licking her lips. &quot;So much sweet young blood under one roof&quot;. I tried to dart back, but the only way out was blocked by her. She lunged at me, fangs bared. Before I could even gasp, her teeth sank into my neck. I felt my body go numb, growing weaker by the second, as if my life was going to end at any moment. Suddenly, one of the children hurled a stool at her. The vampire momentarily recoiled for a moment, pulling away from my neck, but almost immediately she bit again, this time in another place, strangely, not drinking a drop. Then, with utter indifference, she tossed me aside to the corner of the room and turned to the others.<br><br>I was barely conscious. Both bite wounds still bled, but there was something else, something unseen, slowly creeping through my veins, as though the bite had cursed me from within. Summoning what little strength I had left, I rose to my feet and motioned the others toward the open doorway. Everyone still able to move bolted forward. &quot;Where do you think you’re going?&quot; the vampire hissed, and in the blink of an eye, her silhouette seemed to dissolve into the air. Before I could realize what had happened, she was already in front of the child who had been first to run, clutching a crimson blade in her hands. With a single motion, she drove it through his chest, then swept it wide, gutting half of those who remained.<br><br>&quot;Well, there goes my fresh blood,&quot; she muttered with a wicked grin. &quot;Looks like I’ll have to bottle it a–&quot;. Never finishing the sentence, with a sickening crack and crunch, an axe buried itself in her skull. Her body limply collapsed to the ground. Behind her stood a hunter. He yanked the weapon free, scooped up the barely breathing boy she had bitten, and turned to us. &quot;Move! Now!&quot; Those of us still standing bolted after him. Soon we reached the door of a small annex of one of the buildings.<br><br>The hunter gently set the wounded down, then pulled a few vials from his satchel and poured two each down his and my throats. The first tasted like plain milk, though a little sour. The second one was a vivid red tincture, which tasted like booze, but it seemed to dull the pain almost instantly. &quot;Feeling better? Good...&quot; he nodded. &quot;Down to the cellar. It should be safer there&quot;. One by one, we descended. The hunter shut the door behind us and told us to stay quiet. In the dark, surrounded by sacks of flour, we barely dared to breathe. Apparently, we were beneath the bakery.<br><br>Outside, we could hear stomping, shouting, and every now and then a muffled explosion. Then, for a time, all went still. We began to hope it was over, until I heard someone approaching the door above. I approached closer to the stairs, straining to listen. Then came a sudden slam – someone was trying to break the door down, hurling themselves against it with full force. Realizing we had to leave immediately, we rushed toward a second exit from the cellar, one that led inside the building.<br><br>At the time, I didn’t think much of it, but later I remembered: the door leading upstairs had been left open. Strange, considering it should’ve been locked from the outside, it was a bakery, after all. Maybe someone else had hidden there before us and hadn’t made it. By the time of the attack, the night was deep, and it was unlikely that anyone had still been working. I guess I’ll never know for sure.<br><br>No sooner had we climbed up than we heard footsteps coming from the stairs behind us. Without hesitation, we scattered, ducking behind shelves stacked with baskets of bread and jars of flour. We didn’t dare make a run for the open door: we were sure there were still vampires prowling outside.<br><br>We held our breath. A figure emerged from the basement. A short, gaunt man. His eyes darted wildly around the room, filled with hunger and fury. The air was thick with the mingled stench of blood, probably from the former owners of the bakery, soaking the floors, rot, dust. All mixed into one suffocating stench. The vampire moved forward slowly, sniffing us out. We pressed ourselves into the shadows of the shelving, too afraid to even breathe. He searched every corner, looked behind barrels, passed right by some of us, yet, by some miracle, saw no one. Then he turned toward the staircase to the second floor and began to ascend. Suddenly, more footsteps were heard from the cellar. A few seconds later, the same hunter who had hidden us before stepped into the room. He was clearly looking for us. The vampire didn’t even have time to turn before the hunter drove his axe into its back. We crawled out from our hiding places and followed him.<br><br>It seemed that when he had first found us, the battle in this part of the city had still been raging, and it was too dangerous to get us to the central headquarters. But now, after some time had passed, only lone vampires remained, like the one who had nearly caught us.<br><br>We finally reached the headquarters. Just outside it, tents made of coarse cloth stretched on stakes had been pulled apart. These are usually used as field infirmaries, but in the city’s real hospitals hadn’t survived, and the wounded had to be treated somehow. Some tents extended right into the ruins of shattered homes. Everything around was frozen. Only occasional moans or screams came from somewhere in the distance.<br><br>The wounded – me and the one the vampire had also managed to injure – were taken to one of the sheds. The fabric was stained – whether with blood or medicine, it was hard to tell. The medics who worked for hunters swiftly treated our wounds with something and bandaged us with rough cloths. It burned, it hurt, but we had no choice but to endure.<br><br>I sat on the ground, every inch of me aching. Staring into a fire lit nearby, I tried to make sense of everything that had just happened. I silently stared at the nearby fire, watching the flames flicker, trying to comprehend what I had just experienced. One of the field doctors hung a sword over it. At first, I didn't understand why. I remember thinking that the vampires had destroyed all the provision warehouses, and now all that was left to eat was iron. The truth was a little different. The doctor soon took the red-hot blade and carried it to a neighboring tent. A moment later, a scream rang out, raw, filled with agony: someone was undergoing an amputation. the scream came a stifled sob and then silence again – only the crackling of the fire and the monotonous rustle of the wind driving ash across the ground. A few people who had already received aid lay nearby. One was unconscious. Another stared blankly ahead, as if their soul had been wandering far from here. An old man with a bandaged head sitting near me put his hand on the shoulder of the child sitting next to him. He tried to comfort him, though he seemed about to burst into tears himself. I looked out from the tent. Hunters were patrolling the streets, their faces grim, eyes cast downward. Dried leaves, mixed with ash and blood, rustled under their boots.<br><br>Even those vampires who had been aimlessly prowling the already cleared areas in search of survivors were beginning to retreat. The sun was slowly rising on the horizon. From the attic window of a house across the street, a bat flew out, making for the fortress walls. But as soon as the first ray of light touched its wings, the creature turned into human form and dropped with a thud on the paving stones. In seconds, fire consumed the body – skin, then bone, turning to ash, which the autumn wind carried away like it was never there. Dawn was breaking through the dove-colored mist drifting through the deserted streets. Light spilled over the rooftops of abandoned homes, glimmered in the dried puddles of blood. It brought no hope – only the grim confirmation that this night had truly happened. That it had been all real. I sat still, watching the people around me – exhausted, wounded, but alive. With great losses, but the people still outlived.<br><br>It was a miracle, a God’s gift, that at least some of those with whom I shared the roof of the temple survived. Fate had claimed not just half of the people I had only just begun to call family, but also the man who had been like a father to us – the pastor. Fragments of memory whirled in my mind: the attack of that vampire, the rescue by the hunter whose name I was never destined to know, the faces of those who were dear to me.<br><br>Against the backdrop of blazing fires and gloomy dawn, I knew this could not continue like that. If I was meant to live, then I would use my life to end this cycle of death. Back then, I had no idea how hard my path would be. But I have no regrets.</p>

  <h2>Case Study I</h2>
  <p><em>by Unknown</em></p>
  <section class="page">
    <p>Case study: transmutational mechanics of adepts for vampiric suppression engagement<br>First, there is a need to know what is so typical for a Vampire Hunter.<br>Well, villagers living in hunter controlled villages have to frequently use injection of garlic serum, supplied by the Hunters in order to protect themselves from the conversion. That is why their blood is poisonous to vampires<br>But the Hunter — human Hunter — needs only one and is immune ever after. On the other hand, they need to use a chair with handcuffs, because the adepts will find themselves in crippling pain.<br>Those who did study The Century of Evolution the old and relatively known chronicle, or have some advanced knowledge of the history, know the main difference between villagers and humans: all of humanity are (very inaccurately said) already vampires. Vampirism is like a chain, and the human doesn't stand only on its' end, but also on its' very start. Unlike villagers, whom do not have a trace of it in them, just like the animals don't.<br>Everything possessing vampirism is allergic to garlic. Including human, if they have it directly in their veins. It does not harm the organism, it harms the vampiric nature which is a part of every human being, waiting to turn it into the Mother. While Villagers suffer a minute of muscle discomfort, Hunter adept has to go through an hour of pain, fevers and symptoms of blood poisoning, bringing him literally to the edge of death.<br>That was some comparison, now back to the point of the theory: Why is one shot enough? There were a few theories on this topic of course, but as the time goes, we are coming to a better understanding of what we are actually dealing with.<br>According to my observations, it is important to mention that Hunter blood is not poisonous to vampires, which clearly means that garlic is not present in the blood stream anymore afterwards. There is also an abnormal increase of strength.<br>Based on my research I conclude that the vampire potential is triggered by the garlic intoxication and will cause a massive allergic reaction. While getting rid of the garlic, it grows, influencing the anatomy. It does not turn the adept into a classic vampire from the end of the chain, it was not designed to do that. It was designed to turn him into a hideous giant pile of flesh...<br>But everything based on vampirism shares similar properties, and so the vampiric potential, when it gets better influence over the organism, is increasing strength beyond human levels. But mainly, because of its' unusual extent in this state, it &quot;thinks&quot; that organism has already been vampirised, so it just ignores incoming vampire infections instead of fusing with them and creating another vampirised human.<br>A side effect, not quite unfortunate by me, is that even when there is no need for blood, so there is none consumed, the organism does not know that, and is motivated to get some even when it's useless for it. This leads to an increased aggression in a large percentage of human Hunters.</p>

  <h2>Insights to the History: The Century of Evolution</h2>
  <p><em>by Matheo</em></p>
  <section class="page">
    <p>Insights to the History: The Century of Evolution<br>Processed Version — the piece remains updated with new theories and discoveries by present experts to keep the educational value of the descriptive texts on the matter<br><br>It is supposed to have started circa 300 years ago, when humanity decided to hunt witches in big numbers.<br>I don't exactly know why, but I would presume that it was caused by some deep, intellectual farmer debate.<br><br>Humans never had any paramount government, but between the villages, which were spread relatively close to each other, news were traveling quite quickly.<br><br>The witches were naturally in a great disadvantage against humanity and their numbers were decreasing even further. And therefore, they tried to bargain. They promised that if the chase will cease once for all, they will make humankind more powerful than memory can reach.<br>Based on some diary pages and other historical artifacts I have collected on my travels, there is little doubt that the witches did not actually know what they were doing and the promise of marvelous powers was a spontaneous attempt to save their bare skin, a desperate boast, without a proper idea of what to actually do for humanity.<br>When I think about it now, it makes sense. Why would they develop and keep in store a way to give such powers to humanity? And not use it on themselves in the first place?<br>Now that we know what it really was, the answer could be obvious... but I doubt they would be that morale...<br>And they never explained how it works before they started to prepare their rituals. So even I have a feeling that they might have improvised.<br>Well, with a very short thinking, the folk accepted that offer, of course. Even when I doubt that everyone has agreed, especially after they later found out, how it works. Clearly the oblivious majority was fine with it, arranged everything and festively promised to leave witches alone.<br><br>They still lived alone in their huts or wandered through the world afterwards, strictly unaccepting and immediately attacking humans. But finding them today is not so dangerous, I have heard that witches of today are only a shadow of what they were before. I do not know if that is true, but they in fact do not seem capable of actions their ancestors were. Perhaps their power was in their united efforts.<br>When the agreement had spread through more villages, the witches started working on their side of the arrangement. They all united, which they have never done ever after. They used their dark arts and with connected force they casted an ultimate spell into the core of human nature.<br><br>Once they had described how exactly it works, some were asking them to remove it again, but they replied that even if they would want to, they doubt it is even possible. Some were killed, but almost everyone fled their own way before we, humans, could actually do something. Even if we actually could have.<br>I personally think that from the very start it was just an attempt for revenge. That the witches have done it all from a presumption that it will lead humanity into self-destruction.<br><br>The witches explained to humans, that when an individual of their race is exposed to long-term extreme stress and chased to the edge of their strength and life, there is a certain small chance that the spell will take action. But this person will only serve as a wellhead of power to others, he himself will not have basically any. Paradoxically, of Them, he will be the strongest.<br><br>Another dark age came forth to humanity by that time. Time, when power-hungry radicals tortured the ones they were supposed to look after or that they kidnapped, and then chased them starved into the woods for monsters to take, hoping they will transmute and give them the promised power.<br><br>When the Transmutation does actually happen, the mentioned near-dead individual changes himself into a giant kind of lightly blue mass of flesh. It then grows with a site of thin, hair-like &quot;roots&quot; into the ground, similar to the mushroom mycelium, and starts to suck life from the surrounding lands and from everything standing on it. The ground around becomes infected and a mist starts to come out of it, as if the earth was breathing it out... it covers the sunrays which are deadly to everything of this nature...<br>Everything that is born on this ground is... marked. Everything is one with the transmuted individual, the Mother... The animals that are born here, are changed, and immediately attack and eat their parents. The trees that are growing in cursed earth, absorbs every living thing that touches them and they feed the Mother with it.<br>And as her root-web expands, so expands the whole forest.<br><br>The church later started to use the term &quot;Vampirism&quot; for getting overtaken by this nature.<br><br>The Mother then started giving birth to the last pieces of the chain that was supposed to allow human to evolve into the next stage...<br>There are two of them...<br>When a tree does devour humans , it feeds itself and the Mother with their blood. There must be vampiric essence distributed into the body afterwards. Between the hunters it is told, that with their blood, their life force is also taken by the forest, from which the Ghosts manifests themselves. (Update note to the script) All Ghosts have vanished without trace a few decades ago. The cause of is phenomenon still unknown to us.<br>The humans are thrown out by the tree afterwards and awaken as an original Vampyr... they are able to endure a damage much more fatal than any human, before their body completely fails. And a Vampyr has a lot of other abilities, but on the other hand it suffers a complete loss of memory and personality. According to recent observations, its intelligence drops to perhaps even lesser than animal level... and so this existence wanders through the night and does the one and only thing it was probably created for — spreading the Vampirism.<br>Of all the creations of the Forest it is the only one capable of vampirising a human being...<br>Which of course becomes an undead, too. Develops an inability to survive on anything other than blood of the living beings. Even though it is not deadly to them yet, sensitiveness to the sunlight develops. And also the unexplained ability to read their surroundings — which all of the undead have — even despite of complete absence of light or even very eyeballs, like it is in the case of the resurrected skeletons. The newborn vampire can gradually develop other abilities and become more difficult to kill by normal means, but for that, they need the Number Two...<br>And those are the only literal children of the Mother — Vampire Barons and Baronesses — extremely powerful vampiric beings, wearing a ragged red cape and reassembling a frightening monstrous cross-way between bat and human, with lightly blue skin and big red glowing eyes, created from Mothers own flesh and from her &quot;roots&quot; through the trees spread out into the Forest. (Update note to the script) This was only a theory, which nowadays seems likely to be misguided. It seems that the Barons are, in fact, strongly mutated vampyrs, probably advanced ones. However, a hypothesis of this kind is not easy to confirm, as it is very difficult and dangerous to observe the life-cycles inside of the Vampire Forests.<br>They are possessors of many extravagant vampiric powers, which a vampire can gradually also take advantage of  through a ritual in which they absorb so-called &quot;pure blood&quot; which they can get from Baron corpses. By that time, they cannot withstand the sunlight anymore. They can for example learn to summon a bat swarn as their cover and shield. That has a probable relation to Barons' ability to endlessly summon groups of child-looking vampiric creatures who are protecting them. (Update note to the script) It was reported that the Barons across the world were not seen to use this ability for a long time. It is probable that they do no longer possess it. At the same time, it is said that their appearance has also changed to very human-like. That would imply a theory that, for some reason, their vampiric mutations are not as rapid as they once were. On the other hand, seemingly their subconscious desire for aristocratic cloth have taken even more intense measure. However, we are still not sure if they are are stealing the clothes somewhere, nor where they would even steal it. Some think that they grow them on their bodies. But this hypothesis is yet taken as... absurd. The ragged red capes was replaced by black velvets with gold lining. The Baronesses do wear heavy and wide dresses with rich drapery. But do not let that misguide you, they are still frighteningly fast and no less dangerous.<br>A tale for scaring children seemingly later came from that. According to which, children, who shall not return to their homes before the dusk, will be found outside by a monster with red eyes, the Baron of the Night, and they will have to wander with him as his servants. When  children asked, why he would not come directly into their house and take them, parents explained  that he cannot enter ones' home without invitation. Unfortunately, this statement may be based on a lot, but not the truth. Yet Barons do not, for whichever reason, seem to occur anywhere outside the Vampire Forests.<br>Also, I have once heard something about some mad vampire lady and the &quot;altar of darkness&quot;, but I consider it more of a story to say when sitting by a campfire, than a real historical event.<br><br>Many people of that time, as many people of today, believed, that this new form of human is superior to the &quot;old&quot; one, and should even be worshiped, since it will lead humanity forth to greatness and progress.<br>However, it was happening that one of these superior humans, drunken by power, started to act absolutely recklessly towards their surroundings and the land was then full of changed animals, and villages were ending completely infested with vampirised villagers.<br>Villagers, as we might know, are not exactly human and their origin is still covered with mystery. Thus their change is primitive, and just like the animals, they become a little stronger, blood-thirsty and helio-allergic. There are not many other benefits for them, so they are not exactly welcoming of it.<br>Luckily, there is a way to cure the villager vampirism, and that is by zombification; the zombie infection attacks the organism and always overpowers the vampiric essence. After it replaces it completely, all that is left to do is to initiate a standard treatment with a potion of weakness and a golden apple and the villager is cured. But, of course, the villagers' chance of survival of a zombie attack is... low. (Update note to the script) Zombies ceased to attack vampirised villagers. Many hunter experts are now trying to figure out how to exploit this effect to easily reverse turned livestock and attacked villagers with the highest perceptual success rate possible.<br><br>And so there were also those, who feared the Vampirism. The fact that it was the work of the witches, which were never exactly trusted, and that They could not withstand sunlight, which was considered a friend of all living and, how the church then believed, the look of the eye of the God itself, convinced them that it is an unnatural evil and must be destroyed. And if not that, then at least effectively suppressed.<br>It was decided that this should be accomplished by the science elite of that time — therefore the church. The research then must have been very frustrating, since the only universal weakness of vampires that was known, was the Sun, which could not be used very well in practice.<br>The development stopped here for some time. Furthermore, the majority of the church were villagers, which are not born to fight. So for the vampire hunt they tried to train and gear up humans with great temperament, who have not necessarily felt called to the God, but still had some kind of conviction. Actually after some time, the majority of humans, who did not become vampires, became their hunters. A lot of those brave people did never return from their journey, often they were turned during their mission, without any way to regain their humanity back.<br>Except one...<br>One of the first artifacts of the fight with the curse was so-called &quot;altar of cleansing&quot;. The church declared it as &quot;a tool of Gods' mercy&quot; It represented an &quot;outcome&quot; for those vampires, who have grown disgusted of what they were now and were looking for a way out. The altar did not offer a return to the human life. But it was offering them a human death. In the moment when a vampire perished, it became human again, and thus did not have to automatically go right into damnation. That was the statement of the church, at least.<br>This method was often used by infected hunters, slowly but surely reducing the churches military force. However, I have heard that it is possible to survive through the &quot;cleansing&quot; with the help of a certain magical artifact... a totem, which the shamans from dark forests are supposed to make. It is said that a life of some of shamans' victims is trapped there. At the moment the holder of the totem dies, his life is replaced with a life trapped inside the totem, which breaks into pieces afterwards.<br><br>But then, of course, came the universal solution:  humans found another ultimate weakness of vampires... garlic.<br>It is not known how exactly this was discovered , but one popular (and quite amusing) tell-tale says that some hunter took a garlic bread for food on a hunting trip once. When he did fight a particular strong vampire, the vampire already started to push onto him in an attempt to sink her fangs into his neck. With the last strength gathered, the hunter let out an echoing battle-cry, and unintentionally breathed into the face of his opponent. When she smelled the hunter’s garlic breath, she instantly fainted, rolled off him, and in addition to pain-filled howling and coughing, started to tap the ground around herself, disorientated. The hunter did not waste a second and in one strike, ended the vampire’s unlife. And thus, the investigation on the effect of garlic on Vampirism was started.<br><br>I do not know how much truth is in this story. After all, I don’t think that simple garlic breath would force a vampire into such theatrical reaction, but in every tale, you have to expect some additional decorating, don’t you? Truthfully, it sounds more like some kind of a joke about how unpleasant garlic breath can be. However, this popular legend gave birth to a small hunter-tradition. Every proper hunter should have a small supply of garlic bread with them. By offering a piece of garlic bread to another hunter, one shows friendship and belonging towards them.<br><br>After the discovery of the effects of garlic, a new wave of experiments came. The hunters went fighting with garlic on their bodies, but that did not prove itself to be an effective defence. The garlic could be ripped off during combat, it also didn't have much of a particular effect on the vampires and so on… and so the infections continued and hunters were wandering to the altar of cleansing.<br>Research on garlic continued further. Clothes were drenched in its extract, later on  a special armor was developed, which was poisonous to the vampires on contact. It is also said that a large meal of garlic bread (or garlic itself, although rather unpleasant for consumption) can negate Sanguinare Vampiris while it is still active.<br><br>And then, an idea was born… an idea, that probably the only way to prevent conversion, would be to get the garlic essence directly into human bloodstream. And that is where the alchemists have pointed their efforts. Casualties during these experiments were very high… I even think that a few cases of the Transmutation itself occurred. When the experiments on livestock and villagers were fruitless, focus moved more on the human part. The experiments were first performed on turned hunters, but that has proven ineffective.<br>And finally, by means absolutely unknown to me (but probably at the cost of a lot of witchering and test subjects), they managed to create a new breed of garlic, which, later on, supplanted the native one.<br>Interesting about it is, that when compared to the native garlic, it has a lot less noticeable unpleasant smell. The main benefit though is, that it is possible to create an extract from it, which can be harmlessly injected into ones blood.<br><br>Relatively.<br><br>It is nothing fatal, only about an hour of fevers, poisoning and feeling of burning alive. I do not see through this matter entirely, and I do not want to assume, how the procedure works. But a Hunters that went through this infusion will no longer be able to host Sanguinare Vampiris inside their body, even if ten of Them would sink their teeth into their flesh. A human that goes through this procedure gains this immunity as well as increased physical strength, which, with ongoing training, goes beyond human levels. I have heard that elite trained Hunters can throw a punch as strong as four normal miners, farmers or lumberjacks combined. Swinging around with large battle axes, so heavy that when they hit an enemy, it will knock them flying ten meters back. And this tool resting in hands that manipulate it so swiftly, like if it would only have a shred of its actual mass. Years and years and years of work and experiments to bring forth the answer to the new bloodsucking dangers embodied in this creation of brutal strength and extermination. However, elite Hunters are extremely rare, as the vast majority finishes only basic training. They are often to be found camping in groups across the wilderness. (Update note on the script) More recent expert studies show high probability of garlic irritating vampiric nature inside the human being. This mutual collision most likely causes large allergic reaction, and results in partial transmutation of the organism. Traces of garlic extract are repelled from the body shortly after. This in body reaction might be reason for the gained strength. This would suggest that Hunters actually activate the same vampiric nature that gives Vampires their strength, but in a different way.<br><br>A path to previously unusable armory based on heavy weapons and heavy armor was thus opened to the Hunters now. They stopped dying pointlessly and their numbers were increasing again. Shortly after, they separated themself from the church and declared themselves an independent guild.<br>However, even though the Hunter guild is not under the church anymore, not much really changed. System of disciple training was relatively independent already before. For the basic training you only had to find one of the numerous wandering or camping Hunters and pay them a certain amount of vampire blood. This ‘currency‘ is being quite commonly used as a payment for training. Not without a reason. It can be particularly useful among the Hunters as it can be used as a resource for some recipes. And in this case, it also shows the competence of the adept. If you are unable to survive through the night and gather blood from some low Vampyrs without dying or giving up, then there is no point wasting time and effort into training you, and you are better off dying or giving up.<br><br>If you want to go deeper into the secrets of a fight with a Vampire, you have to find elder professional hunters with advanced training, who live in some villages. They never abandon their home, since they suffer from permanent effects and damages from experimenting on their body with the brewery of blood potions. Or they just do not feel like hunting anymore. They are often very strong and resistant, but too slow for a work in terrain. At least those are the symptoms I have heard about.<br>Thus they live a residential life, passing their experience on the novices. If you would be interested, they can teach you some part of this potion brewery for example. Or other skills about Hunter alchemy and technology.<br>From them you shall get the highest education you can get for the work in this terrain.<br>(Update note to the script) The blood potions are nowhere to be found nowadays. They were scrapped and their creation is no longer taught, as they were deemed ineffective during combat and too harmful towards the organism. They were replaced by the more recently discovered use of regular potions infused with dangerous and very potent ingredients, vampire blood including. The metabolism of a hunter can handle these without an issue and thus they are very useful in battle.<br><br><br>I do not know everything about the vampiric breed, but let this knowledge I have gathered and rested on a paper guide you... and tell you the story about how the world drifted into even further uncertainty.</p>

  <h2>Hunter's Diary</h2>
  <p><em>by Unknown</em></p>
  <section class="page">
    <p>Day one<br> A small group of hunters myself included have just been sent out to defend a village and, if possible, launch an attack on the nearby vampire forest. Being new at hunting vampires I was a little nervous, but Marcus, another hunter reassured me.</p>
  </section>
  <section class="page">
    <p>Night one<br> Not much happened tonight, a few vampires were spotted but none came close. They seemed to eye the villagers but retreated upon seeing our weapons. I'm still not sure why we have to use these axes specifically, Marcus just told me that the vampires don't die easily and that these just put them down quicker but never a solid reason. I'll try out another weapon if I ever get the chance.</p>
  </section>
  <section class="page">
    <p>Night two<br> I'm skipping making day entries as nothing of note ever happens, I will however mention that I bought a plain iron sword off of one of the local blacksmiths. A few vampires attacked, there were no losses but one did manage to bite a villager. Unsurprisingly they went down quick and weren't much to handle.</p>
  </section>
  <section class="page">
    <p>Night three<br> This night was bad. There was a small attack staged by a group of vampires on the village, I was given the opportunity, so I dealt with one only with my iron sword. I now understand why Marcus told me to use these axes, after a few moments its limbs regrew, and it literally got back up! Something about these axes being salted or holy keeps them from regenerating. After dispatching it with my axe I returned to my group to see a strange vampire exit the forest slowly, she seemed different. Not only was she dressed in fine almost royal garments, but she seemed to walk with confidence. I would later learn this was one of the &quot;barons&quot; of the forest, a type of much stronger vampire that seems to enthrall others to their will. After a moment of pause the others charged her. To this day I do not think I will forget what I saw that night, Rutherd was first to go. He went in for a swipe of his axe, effortlessly she seemed to avoid the hit and backhanded him. With that single hit he had been sent back, his flimsy leather torn easily as his cheekbone seemed to break from the hit. The others backed up, a smiled seemed to form on her face. Marcus then charged with Alex, a sort of scissor attack going on both sides. To our sudden horror the baron just vanished into straight air, or so we had thought. Horror turned to fear as we had learned the hard way that this one could turn herself invisible. Alex's axe was suddenly knocked from his hand as the now invisible baron latched onto his neck with her fangs, he would have died from blood loss if Marcus didn't step in and attack her with his axe. A sudden shriek was heard as she let go of Alex and swiped at Marcus, which he blocked with the blade of his axe. Whatever wound he had inflicted didn't seem to heal, when her hit was blocked by his axe blade her hand seemed almost burned. A look of fear went across her face as it dawned on her that she was very much so viable to die. I charged in from behind, a small stake in hand. I'd have slain her if she hadn't suddenly grown claws and large wings that quite literally slammed into me. As I was knocked on the ground from the sheer impact of these wings. Alex ran to attack with Rutherd who had healed with the use of one of our potions, The baron swiped at Alex while simultaneously using her wings to slam into Rutherd and defend her backside. Suddenly, Marcus had pulled a vial of holy water with the label &quot;ultimate&quot;. While the baron was about to decapitate Alex Marcus threw it at her. The sound she made was terrible, a loud hiss that rang in ears disorientating us. Her flesh was horribly burned and started to fall off her body, while writhing in pain I quickly got up and drove my axe deep into her skull. With that she crumpled to the ground, and this night was over.</p>
  </section>
  <section class="page">
    <p>Day four<br> After our attack against the baron, we were moved back to HQ and put up in the hospital. Some other team was sent in our place.</p>

  <h2>Blood Infusion Breakthrough</h2>
  <p><em>by Hnat Feldsher</em></p>
  <section class="page">
    <p>Dear Marcus G.,<br><br>I am writing to inform you of the latest discoveries we have made in your absence. It seems that, despite our misgivings, the injection of properly purified vampire blood does indeed produce favorable results.<br><br>Unfortunately, despite all our precautions, one of our volunteers got infected with Sanguinare. However, we re-injected him with garlic and the disease has passed. Apparently, the effect was not as strong as a vampire bite, for example, so a very small dose of antidote was enough. We made sure no one else was hurt, and thank God there were no more infections or injuries. I hope this will continue to be the case.<br><br>Moving on to the main topic, we were about to ask for your permission, as the head of the group, to declare the end of the experiments, but then two men showed unprecedented effects after being injected. One of them has significantly improved vision in the dark, while the other one now has the ability to breathe underwater. We're not sure yet if they've acquired these quirks permanently or if they'll go away at some point, but I think it's already promising. If we continue our experiments, perhaps the community of hunters will be able to gain access to some of the Great Gifts, and that’s worth a lot. This is probably a pretty good way to achieve this. There is some truth to your hypothesis, Grid, even if we didn't take it seriously at first. Please return from the headquarters as quickly as possible, your assistance is essential.<br><br>Yours sincerely,<br>Hnat Feldsher.</p>

  <h2>Journal of a Mad Man</h2>
  <p><em>by Unidentified</em></p>
  <section class="page">
    <p>It's been one day since my so-called &quot;friends&quot; left me in the middle of this desert. I must be going crazy because not only have I been hearing these... whispers... but also had this urge... like something powerful is calling me... Ah why bother, I'm just losing myself aren't I?</p>
  </section>
  <section class="page">
    <p>I've been wandering for a few days now, each day the whispers seem to grow louder and clearer? I feel a greater desire to find whatever is making it... I'm not even sure why I'm still walking — it's just that something tells me I need to keep going this way, maybe God is trying to save me?</p>
  </section>
  <section class="page">
    <p>I-I could hear her clearly today! The whispers were so... beautiful so... elegant! Whatever it- She is, she's calling me! The pull I feel is so strong now, I feel so close to her now!</p>
  </section>
  <section class="page">
    <p>I may have made a mistake... I-I wandered into these dark woods searching for her... but as I get closer I feel such a deep level of dread, red eyes watch me from the fog but vanish when I try to reach them. Every time I turn to leave the screaming turns me around... back to her...</p>

    <p>It's all fine now. The storm has passed, mother has guided me. My hands once vacant are now filled with purpose — Her purpose — mothers purpose. I feel so charmed, so complete. Mother has given me purpose, she can give you purpose to. Come to the woods. Come to the woods.</p>

  <h2>A Maid's Diary</h2>
  <p><em>by Unknown</em></p>
  <section class="page">
    <p>He used to be normal. Respected, admired, and rich beyond anyone's imaginations, but one by one, everyone in his life left him. It began when he came back from visiting his sister, who lived farther south in a much larger city than this small village. Upon receiving news that she had been attacked, he raced off into the night, hoping to be at her bedside when she died. When he returned, gone was the man we once knew. He shut himself away in his mansion, firing half of his staff, keeping on only those he trusted, and for some reason, me. The mansion felt cold and lifeless, and this feeling only grew as it fell into disrepair. Over time, everyone started to quit, traveling to the city in search of a better paying job, but I stayed, among the cobwebs and layers of dust, and did the best I could to care for the house and its inhabitant. I began to notice strange behavioral changes. I'd often find him performing strange rituals in the dead of night, making sure all curtains were shut in the daytime, and he began to look... hungrier. Every day I would prepare his dinner, but each night he would stare with increasing disdain. For a while he would attempt to eat the food, but he at some point he stopped, instead just glaring at the dish with a sense of rage, and a bit of sadness. One day, I decided to skip making dinner for him. He never ate it anyway, and I had better things to do with my time, but as the clock struck nine, he suddenly appeared in the doorway of my small room. &quot;Dinner. Now&quot; he demanded, with a hungry look in his eyes. So terrifying was his demeanor, it was like his eyes shone red in the dark. He stalked off, and I immediately raced off to the kitchen. With shaking hands, I prepared his meal, as he sat deadly still at the head of the dinner table. The fire roared, and the room had grown hot, but his face was like that of a corpse. Pale, devoid of all blood. His eyes seemed sunken, lifeless like the home we stood in. Overcome with my thoughts, my hand slipped, and my kitchen knife cut into my palm. I quickly grabbed a hand towel to stop the bleeding, but the knife had cut deep. &quot;Maid! Where is my meal?&quot; he yelled from the dining room. Shaking, with the hand towel still wrapped around my wound, I picked up the plate, gathered his silverware, and entered the room. As soon as I entered, he stiffened. &quot;Have you prepared something new today?&quot; he asked in a gentle voice. I froze, &quot;No sir. It's what you always request. Steak... rare.&quot; He stared at me, then smiled a little. I could swear I saw beast-like teeth, glistening in the candlelight. &quot;Put it down on the table&quot; he said, in a low growl, as he stood up and began making his way towards me. Nervous, I took a step back, and with that, he began to speed up. His shadow grew, lengthened by the roaring fire behind him, and as it reached me, I turned and darted into the kitchen. The plate shattered behind me, as I threw open the doors and looked for a place to hide. I quickly grabbed the kitchen knife I had cut myself with, and ducked behind the counter. The doors flew open, slamming into the walls and knocking over a broom I had left standing there. I peered around the corner to see him standing there, hungrily in the doorway. &quot;I can smell your blood. It's quite sweet, and I haven't eaten in so long...&quot; he whispered as he stalked into the room. I looked down in horror at my hand, with blood still seeping through the cloth. Suddenly, he slammed his hands onto the counter, and stared menacingly at me from above. I tried to move out of the way, but he grabbed my hair and slammed my head onto the counter. &quot;You know...&quot; he started, gazing hungrily at me, &quot;I've tried drinking from rats, from the chickens, even from the neighbors damn dog, but they've never been able to satisfy my thirst. A human though? The world can always do with one less of you.&quot; Disoriented, I struggled to move as he slowly sunk his teeth into my neck. It was terrible as I felt the blood drawn out of my body. I could feel myself becoming weaker, but I managed to raise my knife and plunge it into his chest. Gasping, he backed away, coughing up the very blood he had just been drinking, and crumpled to the ground. I watched him die in horror, as I realized that I was now a murderer. It may have been in self-defense, but no one would ever believe me. I stood frozen in shock, and just as I could no longer bear to watch him succumb to death, I saw it. The monster began to stir. It seemed that he had hung in a state between life and death, until his powers brought him back to life. As he started to move, I knew what I had to do. Steadying myself, I took my knife, still red with blood, and aimed directly at his heart. The knife sunk deep, and with one final look of rage, the light faded from his eyes, and at last he was at peace. Stepping away, I began to plan my next move. I was just a lowly maid, who was now left with the corpse of an aristocrat. He may not have been loved in his final moments, but that didn't take away his power. I would likely be hung for my crimes. I wasn't dead yet though. I still had time to escape before his body was found. I looked down at my dress, now soaked in his blood, and went to my room to pack everything I had. I had to leave in the dead of night to avoid suspicion. I had been locked away in this mansion for so long, I was sure it would have been a shock to see me in the town, much less in a blood-soaked dress. I didn't have much, so all I took with me was a small suitcase. I made sure to change my outfit to avoid suspicion, but still brought with me my now soiled dress. I would have to find a place to wash out the stains, but it was the only other outfit I owned. I couldn't afford to leave it behind, nor could I let someone else find it and start tracking me down. I began to feel lethargic, but I blamed it on the blood loss I had just suffered. I couldn't believe all this time, I had been living in the same home as a vampire. I had only read stories about them, these terrible creatures that came in the dead of night, to drain you of life. I was terrified to realize they exist, a nightmare come true. Once I found a safe place, I vowed to find a way to protect myself from these beasts. I left the house, armed with the knife that had saved my life, my suitcase, and a coat, for I had begun to feel extremely cold despite the warm summer breeze. I made my way towards the docks, determined to make it aboard a ship and travel as far as I could from this hell.</p>

  <h2>My Prince</h2>
  <p><em>by Unknown</em></p>
  <section class="page">
    <p>I have been with the prince for 10 years now. He arrived to this forest a weak creature, stumbling around on the search for blood, when he discovered this was a place for creatures like him. I didn't pay much attention to him at first. Newly turned, he wasn't yet strong enough to take on the barons that dominated this land, so he kept to himself most of the time. I had other things to worry about, like the hunters that often wandered in to take our blood and souls. Everything changed however, when he took down the first baron. It wasn't the strongest one, ranked fairly low in our hierarchy, but from then on he was seen as a threat. He started collecting the pureblood of the barons, using it in strange rituals in the dead of night, where a red beam would shoot down towards him, bathing the vampire in a crimson light. At first I feared him and his curious ways, but after a while I started to admire his power. After spending time in our forest and growing in strength, he soon became known as Lord. The hunters of the nearby village had heard of his power, and arrived often to take down this dark threat in their lives. He always persevered, but in this world he was without allies. That is, until he approached me. Handing me a scroll, he asked me to join him. Speaking of the turmoil and hardships that vampires like him faced, he said that he wished to grow stronger, and protect the vampires of this forest. I quickly agreed, and found myself under the leadership of this fierce vampire. He gave me weapons, armor, even a name. Before this I had lost all focus, aimlessly wandering around, searching only for blood and fighting any that stood in my way, but now I had a purpose. He soon gathered more followers, those that worked towards the same purpose as him, and became known as the Prince of these dark lands. One night he gestured for me to follow him, and led me to a chest. He spoke in a whisper, ensuring none would overhear what he would say next. &quot;As my most trusted minion, I would like to show you something.&quot; Turning, he opened the chest and pulled out a cloak and a bottle of pureblood. Quickly, he threw the cloak around his shoulders, and uncorked the bottle. Lifting the pureblood to his lips, he drained it, and from his back something monstrous grew. Crimson wings unfurled behind him, and stretched out as my Prince stood tall. He laughed at the look of shock on my face. &quot;Don't worry, these are just temporary&quot; he said. &quot;They will disappear in a few minutes. I discovered this effect during my experiments.&quot; My shock turned to amazement, as I reveled in how much we still didn't know about our own species. &quot;I've been working in secret on how we can continue to improve ourselves. I can assure you, these wings are just the start of uncovering how powerful we can become.&quot; He soon left the room, leaving me to take in this amazing new discovery. One day we would leave this dark forest and bring a new era to the world. I'm not sure yet what this will entail, but I am confident that with my Prince leading the vampires of this land, we can take on any obstacle that dares stand in our way.</p>

  <h2>Nocturnal</h2>
  <p><em>by William</em></p>
  <section class="page">
    <p>Upon the moonlit tapestry of night, mine eyes have perceived thee, a mortal, dare to peer into the night, where only those of mine own kind fear to tread. An unwieldy edifice thou hast raised, the product of thy witless endeavour, 'tis but an illumination to mine night-ridden eyes. I watched thee, in thy folly, attempt to fashion a mechanism, a contraption of strange design. Alas, compromised by the foolishness of its creator, 'twas set aflame by thee.<br><br>Yet, amidst mine figure draped in darkness appeared, as panic seized thee, and my gaze bidding thee to stillness, whilst ascending to quell the blaze. Frozen thou standest, atop thine fiery creation, when a noble vein in me stirred, compelling me to have felt a peculiar affection.<br><br>A chronicle, whispering of the ancient paths I left, guiding thee to my shrine. Thereafter, thou embarked on a sacred pilgrimage, building thine own devoted shrine in the shadows of thy attic, adorned with blood-drenched altars, eternal flames, and gold that gleamed like the starlit night.<br><br>Thy soul, thou gifted unto me, a moment of great merriment that echoed through the ether, the sweet symphony of thy devotion. In thine sire’s honour, thou built a tavern of sanguine sustenance, a beacon of respite for those of my ilk, acknowledging our shared existence, not as predator and prey, but as equals in these planes of infinite twilight.<br><br>Upon mine throne, in a fit of primal desire, I tasted thy life's essence when I sank my fangs into thy tender flesh. Yet quickly remorse followed, ‘twas when I reversed the curse of mine kin, only to banish the monster within thee. Such is the sovereign of a vampiric prince, such is the might of my will.</p>

  <h2>Observation on Vampires</h2>
  <p><em>by Unknown</em></p>
  <section class="page">
    <p>Vampires have recently shown up in this area. They are disgusting creatures, surviving solely off of blood and human hearts. Even the creepers know to be afraid of them. I feel they suspect that they are not humans, instead something of an unnatural origin. Sadly, the vampires do not have this effect on zombies and skeletons, even appearing to have a friendly relationship with them. I fear that one day the dead will rise and I will lose this peaceful place I call home, but for now I will fight back with all I have.</p>

  <h2>Pyromaniac's Diary</h2>
  <p><em>by Pyromaniac Pik</em></p>
  <section class="page">
    <p>It started months ago. People in my village have always led a peaceful life, but recently a new person moved to town. He was a strange fellow, only emerging from his house at night and rarely talking to the townsfolk. He seemed shifty, but I really started to keep an eye on him when his neighbor's livestock were drained, left in the fields devoid of blood. That night he seemed energized, stronger than usual. I began to watch him after the sun set, often forgoing sleep in favor of finding out what he was up to. Like clockwork, he would emerge from his house as the sun was setting and disappear into the shadows. Sometimes I could have sworn his eyes glowed red as he set off into the night. He looked human but felt... off. After a few weeks in town, he began to get visitors late at night. They would often come weak-looking and tired, but leave refreshed, with bottles full of a red liquid. As time went on the livestock in the surrounding area slowly died. When found, they would be completely drained, with 2 puncture ones somewhere on their body. People began to suspect there was a monster in the nearby forest, but I knew the truth. That man was somehow behind this. One morning, a farmer awoke me, claiming that the monster had attacked, but one cow survived. He claimed the animal had become violent, and it's eyes had grown blood red. He led me to the barn, where he had trapped the creature, and I decided that it was time to figure out this mystery. The next night, very carefully, I took the cow and put it in a nearby shed. I began my experiments. Learning what this creature was consumed my nights, and I soon grew careless. The man who lived in town was no longer being watched, and was out of livestock. Without a nearby source of blood, he soon moved to the townspeople. I paid no attention, and one by one, these people disappeared. Some would return, but they were different, often staying inside their houses until the sun had set. The town was empty, but it became alive at night. I ignored the loud yelling I often heard, assuming everything was okay. As I worked, I found the cow was susceptible to some things. It often became weak when in contact with water, or near garlic. It became sluggish and weak, but it didn't harm it. I needed something to defeat the creature that had moved to my town. Finally, I came upon my solution. Fire. One flame and the cow ignited, quickly burning to ashes. I had lost my test subject, but gained a new weapon. I went to bed that night satisfied with my work, but woke up to screams only minutes later. I grabbed my flint and steel and rushed out the door to help. Emerging from my house I tripped and crashed to the ground. To my horror. I had tripped over the body of my neighbor, a small old woman who lived alone with her dog. I was aghast. Who could have done such a thing? She was an innocent person who would never harm a soul. I found my answer as I looked up, seeing that strange man approach. His eyes glowed red as he licked the blood from his sharp, pointed teeth. &quot;Surprised?&quot; he said, drawing closer, eyes locked on me. Behind him, I saw once familiar faces now distorted, desperately searching for blood. This town was dead, and I was the only human remaining. With my flint and steel in hand, I knew what I had to do. The undead creature dove for me, but I hit him away and ran off into the night. I soon arrived to an abandoned building in the middle of town, and set it ablaze. The flame grew unbearably hot, but all I could do was watch the fire grow larger, and consume the town I once knew and loved. I would make them all burn. These creatures that consumed our livelihood, our people, everything in our lives. I would make them pay. The fire quickly spread, burning the demonic creatures until there were only ashes remaining. I left my home that night with only my flint and steel, but I will stop at nothing to make these vampires burn.</p>

  <h2>Royal Rivalry</h2>
  <p><em>by Unknown Scribe</em></p>
  <section class="page">
    <p>Entry 1: I have been hired to accompany a group of &quot;vampire&quot; hunters into one of those dark forests that seem to appear randomly, I am to take notes of what we see. I am unsure what they're expecting to find, but they're paying good money. We will journey there in the morning.</p>
  </section>
  <section class="page">
    <p>Entry 2: I must admit I am finding this place remarkable, its almost as if the very plants suck the life from the soil; sharp thorns and alarmingly jagged bark. Oddly, I keep hearing this quiet voice, calling to me. Singing in my head, drawing me deeper into the woods. When I asked the &quot;hunters&quot; if they heard the same they just nodded, and told me &quot;not to follow it&quot;.</p>
  </section>
  <section class="page">
    <p>Entry 3: A lot has happened, most importantly, I think I am a believer now. We were attacked by a group of what I thought were other people only to discover extremely sharp teeth, glowing red eyes, alarming speed, and what seems to be regenerative properties? The hunters dispatched them quickly using these strange axes that seemed to almost burn the vampires flesh when made contact.</p>
  </section>
  <section class="page">
    <p>Entry 4: Some strange vampire wearing large extravagant almost royal black clothes stepped out from behind a tree, with a smile and a snap of her fingers a large group of vampires, like zombies, came upon us. The hunters did their best but for every vampire felled another took its place, again, and again, until finally only one hunter remained. The vampire woman, of whom I shall refer to as &quot;The lady&quot; simple smiled and stepped forth. Before he could take a swing she had stabbed her hand through his chest, taking his heart out and eating it. Then, as she turned to me, another vampire almost exactly like her had walked over and started hissing loudly. Another finely dressed vampire had come forth, this time male. She hissed back, her entire eye turning blood red as she wings started to grow from her back and claws from her hands. The other vampire did the same. The two leapt at each other, delivering grievous wounds that seemed to close faster than they could be made. Finally the male had gotten the upper hand, stepping behind her and piercing her heart with his claws. She paused for the moment, taking shallow breaths. As he pulled her heart out she seemed to melt, her blood spilling out onto the grass. The man had suddenly turned on me, but before he could rip me to pieces, another hunter had arrived. Bearing strange all black armor, and a menacing black axe; he fought the man. Before long the hunter won, and planted the axe deep into his head. The man also froze, taking deep breaths, trying to pull the axe from his head. To no avail, for he too melted into a puddle of blood.</p>
  </section>
  <section class="page">
    <p>Entry 5: I don't quite remember what happened afterwards. I simply woke up in a village church, one of the village priests tending to me. The hunter whom had saved my life sitting beside me, reading a letter. After asking how I had come to such a position, he simply told me &quot;Her voice had gotten to you, you tried to attack me.&quot; and no more. I will be taking my pay and never going near one of those forests again.</p>

  <h2>Sinister Intentions</h2>
  <p><em>by Sinister Solace</em></p>
  <section class="page">
    <p>It all started that night, about three hundred and.. twenty seven..? No.. twenty nine.. years ago..<br><br>My parents had locked me in my room, not wanting to hear my begging for food anymore. I sat there crying, the sounds of their shouting and arguing filling the house, when suddenly I heard a light tap on my window. There stood a pale woman with terrible red eyes, dressed in fine silken robes. She beckoned me to the window, a sweet smile on her face. I was frozen in fear. Someone.. no.. something.. dressed in the form of a human woman of which I had never seen was trying to convince me to let it in, and my parents were none the wiser. Then suddenly she vanished, her body melting into smoke. To my absolute horror I felt a tap on my shoulder.. The woman- monster, was standing right behind me. Frozen in fear, all I could do was watch, waiting for her to do something- anything, when to my utter shock she spoke. Her words were as smooth as honey, &quot;My dear, be not afraid. I am here to help you..&quot; She said with a smile, fangs clearly displayed. &quot;They've hurt you, I know they have. I've been watching and listening.&quot; She placed a hand on my shoulder. &quot;Such petty wants and worries, such pathetic reasons to harm a poor sweet child..&quot; She continued, both her hands on my shoulders. She chuckled, and with a speed far greater than I could perceive; she was in front of me, her sinister eyes  holding me in place. &quot;Why don't we deal with them? Won't that be fun?&quot; I then felt something hard in my hand, a large, serrated knife. She then walked towards the door and with a soft knock, blew it off its hinges and stepped forth. My parents fell silent, both a mixture of awe and terror on their face. With a burst of speed both my mother and father crumpled to the floor, the woman having broken their legs. She beckoned me over, and I admit I felt a sense of joy. I was finally going to take back all that these two had taken from me, the nights without food, filled with terror and pain. I would take them back.. and so I did. I drove the blade deep into my father.. The woman just smiled and said &quot;Excellent.&quot;.. The next few moments i'm not entirely sure of. I remember a feeling of pain, deep pain.. then an icy chill, as if all the life had been drained from me. I awoke several days later, far away from my home. I awoke as something far greater than what I was.</p>

  <h2>A Valorous Tale</h2>
  <p><em>by Unknown</em></p>
  <section class="page">
    <p>Once upon a time, or perhaps centuries ago. There was a group of people dedicated solely to the art of war and battle. They lived and died for battle, for the thrill of bloodshed, and for the hope of a warrior's death. Among these people was a woman known as their greatest warrior, never defeated in battle and driven by the single goal of &quot;bravery&quot;.<br>Tragically, she was never given a name, for there was no need. For she was valued solely for her prowess in battle. As a result, the only true name given to her was by those who fled in her wake. &quot;The Valorous One&quot;, earned from tales of her strength, said to be that of a raging volcano, never to be stopped or felled in battle.<br>That is, until the fateful battle. Not much is known about this battle, in fact, there's no way to prove its existence other than first-hand accounts. Legend has it that The Valorous One and her army had come to slay a &quot;walking disaster,&quot; often described as a pale, finely dressed man with dark red eyes and terribly sharp teeth. With a simple gesture, The Valorous One ordered her army to attack. Upon this transgression, the &quot;walking disaster&quot; slaughtered the entirety of The Valorous One's army, leaving only the undefeated warrior herself.<br>Undeterred, she simply drew her blade and met the man in combat. Each inflicted grievous wounds on the other, only for the man's wounds to heal faster than they could be made. Sensing her impending doom, the brave One refused to be defeated. Drawing on the last of her life, she tore every limb from his body in one swift motion that resembled a raging fire. Both, having sustained terrible blows, collapsed. Only the man recovered and rose to his feet. A look of awe and terror on his face. In an instant, the man had moved over her near-dead body and bit her, infecting her with his vile blood.</p>
